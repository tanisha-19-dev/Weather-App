# Weather-App

This is a simple weather web application built using HTML and CSS, which utilizes a weather API to fetch real-time weather data.

## Features
- Displays current weather conditions
- Shows temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- Responsive design for seamless usage on various devices

## Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-web-app.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder.

3. Launch the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## API Usage
This app uses the Weather API to fetch weather data. The API key is already included in the code, but it is recommended to use your own API key for production purposes. You can obtain an API key by signing up on the weather service provider's website.

const apiKey = 'API_KEY';
```
